# Making African Connections: digitisation and data entry workflow

## James Baker, June 2019

This document contains explanatory notes on `2019-06-13_MAC-big-picture-workflow.pdf`, the overarching digitisation and data entry workflow for the [Making African Connections Digital Archive](http://makingafricanconnections.org/).

- The workflow moves from top to bottom.
- Arrows indicate the order of movement.
- Tasks will be actioned by one or more of the project team. These are:
	- FH = Freja Howat-Maxted (Research Assistant in Digital Archiving, University of Sussex)
	- CA = Collections Assistant (based at Brighton & Hove Museums)
	- NS = Nicola Stylianou (Post-Doctoral Research Associate, University of Sussex)
	- JB = James Baker (Senior Lecturer in Digital History and Archives, University of Sussex)
- Data will be moved or stored on various interim and long-term storage. Key for this is as follows:
	- SSD: solid state drive (or, flash/pen drive)
	- HDD: hard disk drive
	- Box: University of Sussex secure 'Box' cloud storage.
	- Figshare: University of Sussex data repository https://sussex.figshare.com/, connected to a Archivematica digital preservation system.
- The Making African Connections Digital Archive is built using the content management system [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) on a [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/) server. As the project develops, content on this site will develop/deviate from content in partner museum catalogues. All the project team will have edit access to this side (administered by JB and NS).

### Some notes on logic

This workflow was developed with a multiple requirements in mind. These include, in no particular order:

- to enable (relative) consistency in photography, record keeping, and processing across three sites.
- to be stress tested by initial batches (Summer 2019) and revised as required.
- to make machine and human readable joins between catalogue data held by three museums.
- to, where required, improve catalogue data held by our museum partners.
- to publish, augment, and preserve catalogue data and photography.
- to balance workloads between all project partners.
- to avoid surprise bottlenecks.
- to exploit useful functionality of the content management systems used by museum partners.
- to use processes that broadly intelligible, repeatable without specialist software/hardware, and able to be documented.
- to create a searchable, browsable digital archive that can last 5-10 years with minimum intervention.
- to build a digital archive around standardised, open source and community owned/supported software tools and file formats.
- to make all data produced exportable into non-proprietary data formats.
